## Miura-ori: Technical Details

### 2.1 Crease Pattern
Each unit cell has **four creases**:
- Two **mountain** folds (same orientation)
- Two **valley** folds (opposite orientation)

They alternate in a zig-zag arrangement so that actuating one crease drives the rest. The tessellation of identical parallelogram cells yields a sheet with a single degree of freedom (1-DOF) during folding.

---
### 2.2 Mathematical Folding Kinematics

**Definitions**
- theta: fold angle of the primary creases 
- psi: fold angle of the secondary creases
- phi acute angle of the base parallelogram (constant)

**Key rigid-foldability constraint**
This relation comes from spherical trigonometry applied to the four-crease vertex, ensuring the pattern rigid-folds with panels treated as rigid facets connected by ideal hinges.

### 4. Engineering Advantages
- **Compact stowage:** high area-to-volume compression
- **Single actuation:** 1-DOF deployment of the entire sheet
- **Even stress distribution:** suitable for thin, fragile substrates
- **Predictable deployment path:** reduced risk of buckling or inversion with pre-creased hinges

### 5. Applications
- Spacecraft solar arrays (e.g.,SpaceX, NASA/JAXA)
- Foldable architecture and deployable shelters
- Deployable antennas
- Compact maps
- Energy-absorbing/metamaterial panels
