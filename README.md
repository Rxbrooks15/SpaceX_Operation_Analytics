2.1 Crease Pattern
Each cell has four creases:

Two mountain folds (same orientation)

Two valley folds (opposite orientation)

They alternate in a zig-zag arrangement so that when you fold one, the others follow automatically.

2.2 Mathematical Folding Kinematics
We define:

𝜃
θ = fold angle of the primary creases (0° = flat, ±180° = fully folded)

𝜓
ψ = auxiliary fold angle of secondary creases

𝜙
ϕ = base parallelogram acute angle (constant)

Key property:
The Miura-ori is rigid-foldable, so 
𝜃
θ and 
𝜓
ψ are not independent — they satisfy a trigonometric constraint:

sin
⁡
(
𝜓
/
2
)
sin
⁡
(
𝜃
/
2
)
=
cos
⁡
(
𝜙
)
sin(θ/2)
sin(ψ/2)
​
 =cos(ϕ)
This comes from spherical trigonometry applied to the hinge network.

3. Compression Ratio
When folded, the planar projection of the sheet shrinks.
For a sheet with 
𝑚
m by 
𝑛
n units:

Original dimensions:

𝐿

𝑎

𝑏

​
 =m⋅a,W

​
 =n⋅bsin(ϕ)
Folded dimensions:

𝐿
(
𝜃
)
=
𝑚
⋅
𝑎
cos
⁡
(

)
L(θ)=m⋅acos(θ/2)
𝑊

=
𝑛
⋅
𝑏
sin
⁡
(
𝜙
)
cos
⁡
(
𝜓
/
2
)
W(θ)=n⋅bsin(ϕ)cos(ψ/2)
Because 
𝜓
ψ is linked to 
𝜃
θ, both 
𝐿
L and 
𝑊
W decrease simultaneously — a rare property for folding surfaces.

4. Engineering Advantages
Compact stowage — extremely high area-to-volume compression ratio

Single actuation — one motor or one pull motion can deploy the entire sheet

Even stress distribution — good for thin fragile materials (e.g., solar panels, maps)

Predictable deployment path — no buckling or accidental inversion if creases are pre-scored

5. Applications
Spacecraft solar panels (NASA/JAXA)

Foldable architecture & shelters

Deployable antennas

Compact maps

Energy-absorbing panels (in mechanical metamaterials)
